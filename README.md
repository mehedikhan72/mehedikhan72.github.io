# Branch Introduction

This branch contains the React code for my portfolio website. The website is hosted at [https://mehedikhan.me](https://mehedikhan.me/).

Once changes are made into this branch, the following command needs to be run to deploy the site using GitHub pages.

```
yarn run deploy
```
